# Managing_Big_Data
This is the code repositary of my project assignment in the master course "Managing Big Data" at University of Twente. Spark was implemented for analysing the Kaggle dataset "Newyork city Taxi Trip Records Dataset" to generate and provide business insights regarding the taxi industry in New York City.
